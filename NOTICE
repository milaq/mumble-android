yesterday, an email arrived telling me that most of this code was reused and published to the android market. usually, i am cool with that.
but unfortunately the douche who published this stated that it was HIS work. this is unacceptable.

this is NOT what open-source is about. i (and we, the other devs) do this solely in my/our free time - for free. and the least thing one could do is to INFORM the developers
who actually worked on this and PROPERLY give credit to them while CLEARLY stating that he/she just compiled the code.

i have absolutely NO PROBLEM when someone reuses my code (this is what opensource is about).
but that does NOT mean that one should forget good manners.

well now, what does that mean now?
that means that i will only release my changes publicly at the point at which i release a binary/compiled version.
i had various commits lingering around in my local git and am developing more.
for now, i will use a private git for check-ins to the mumble-android project.

if you are a serious developer who wants to view/work with those commits, you can contact me and ask for insight and i will give you read access to my private git.

regards,
michael
